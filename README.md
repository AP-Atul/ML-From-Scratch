# ML-From-Scratch
From scratch implementations of some algorithms in Machine Learning SkLearn style in Python

## Algorithms
All algorithms are implemented like sklearn's implementation. Files can be imported and applied to any code just like any other libraries.

  1. Genetic Algorithm


* Clustering
  1. KMeans Clustering
  2. KMedoids Clustering


* Classification
  1. KNN
  2. Logistic Regression
  3. Naive Bayes (Guassian)
  4. Linear Regression (Bayesian)


* Association
